For our final project, we decided to make a humpback whale image classifier. We’re trying to solve the issue of deciding if a given image belongs to a humpback whale or not to ensure proper identification of the species. We will be using mainly PyTorch and MATLAB to create and store the structure of the image (either in a matrix or in corresponding color histograms) that will then be used to create some sort of feature vector to identify the image. We will need to have a method that separates the background from the main object of the image to ensure the background doesn’t weigh into the outcome of whether it’s a humpback whale or not. We’ll also need a training dataset so the program can learn the patterns of the humpback whale and can produce an educated output. For this, we will be using a Kaggle Humpback Whale Identification Dataset. We will be using a neural network to help us with the identification. Our goal is that at the end of the project, our program will be able to take in an image of a notable feature on the humpback whale and determine if it’s a match or not.
