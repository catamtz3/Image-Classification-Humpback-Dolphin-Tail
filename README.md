This is an image classification algorithm that takes in a query image of either a Humpback whale or a dolphin. Based off of the tail of that query image, our program can accurately classify if the tail belongs to a Humpback whale or a Dolphin. Built using Python, Pytorch, MATLAB, and various other techniques.
